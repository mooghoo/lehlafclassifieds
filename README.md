# Project: Lehigh Valley Classifieds


## Description:
This project aims to create a digital marketplace for students in one of the six different higher learning institutions in the Lehigh Valley area. Students will be able to list unwanted items as well as persuse the listings in order to find items they want or need, and get in contact with sellers to negotiate or pay the listed price.

We used AWS App Runner to deploy the web app. We used Railway and Prisma to connect to a database and store the listings. Svelte was brought in to streamline the creation of JavaScript components for the website itself and to speed its creation, and we used TailwindCSS to simplify CSS.

Future expansion of this project could include accounts, which would lead to the introduction of saved listings, a bid system, a school filter system, and distance indicators on listings. None of these improvements would change the fundamental purpose or function of the site, but simply make it a more cohesive experience for users. 



## How to Use the Project:
Navigate to the webpage at [this link](https://kg57rmazgc.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/) and scroll through the listings. Any desired listing can be clicked upon and viewed in greater detail, and the seller can be contacted through the specific listing page.

If the intention is to create a listing, simply click the link, fill out the form, and await responses.
